## Aims
This MATLAB application simulates and animates the real time trajectory of a projectile in 3d space after resolving multiple user defined vectors to determine the launch direction and force.
The user is also presented with the option to add a wall which the projectile may collide with.

# Features
- Standalone vector resolution panel
- Multiple camera angles for trajectory
- Real time trajectory plotting
- Coordinate, dimensional velocity and vertical speed displays
- Time slider for replaying animation and relaying information at selected time
- Two GUI colour themes and brightness slider for dark theme
- Help box to give description for functions within the program

The user has control over the following parameters :
- Projectile coefficient of restitution
- Downward accelleration
- Presence of wall
- Wall height
- Wall distance
- Launch height
